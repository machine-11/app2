If you are buying with other first-timer single(s), up to 2 singles may each be eligible for an EHG (Singles), i.e., a total of up to $120,000. \r\nIf you are buying a resale flat, you must first qualify for the CPF Housing Grant for Resale Flats (Singles) before applying for the EHG. You may also apply for the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) (Singles) if you meet the eligibility conditions.\r\nApply for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter via the HDB Flat Portal for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amount of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for.\r\nCore family nucleus\r\nA households eligibility for housing subsidies and HDB housing loan is assessed based on the core family nucleus, which is formed by the core member(s). Core members refer to the applicant(s) and occupier(s) in an HFE letter application who enable the household to qualify for a flat purchase under an eligibility scheme. All core members must remain in the flat application, and physically occupy the flat during the minimum occupation period (MOP) after the flat purchase.

You may also read our frequently asked questions on the HFE letter.\r\nIncome guidelines\r\nHDB considers the incomes of all persons listed in your HFE letter application to assess your households eligibility to buy a flat, receive CPF housing grants and take an HDB housing loan.\r\nAssessment\r\nGuideline\r\nPeriod of income assessment\r\n12 months\r\nEnd of assessment period\r\n2 months preceding the month of HFE letter application^\r\n^ For example, if your HFE letter application is submitted in May 2024, the assessment period will be from April 2023 to March 2024.\r\nNote:\r\nYou must be working at the point of the HFE letter application to be considered for an Enhanced CPF Housing Grant and HDB housing loan.\r\nApplicant(s) taking an HDB housing loan must remain in their employment or trade when HDB disburses the housing loan.\r\nComputation of income\r\nThe average gross monthly income for each applicant and/ or occupier is the total income earned over the number of months worked during the assessment period. The incomes of all persons (both applicants and occupiers) listed in the HFE letter application are included in the assessment.\r\nFor self-employed persons, the number of months worked will be 12 or from business commencement during the assessment period. \r\nFor employed persons, the number of months worked will exclude months on no-pay leave (treated as unemployment) or from employment commencement during the assessment period. For example, if you worked for 10 months during the income assessment period, your average income earned will be the total income earned for the 10 months divided by 10.\r\nTo illustrate, the average gross monthly household income will be computed as follows:\r\nApplicant 1\r\nApplicant 2\r\nApplicant 3\r\nTotal gross income during the assessment period\r\n$A\r\n$B\r\n$C\r\nNumber of months worked\r\n12\r\n6\r\n10\r\nAverage gross monthly income\r\n$A / 12 = $X\r\n$B / 6 = $Y\r\n$C / 10 = $Z\r\nAverage gross monthly household income\r\n$X + $Y + $Z\r\nIncome components\r\nAll components from employment or trade, including employees CPF deductions and excluding employers CPF contributions and bonuses.\r\nTypes of income/ allowance considered for assessment of household income and credit assessment:\r\n Types of Income/ Allowance\r\n Considered for\r\nAssessment of household income\r\nCredit assessment for HDB housing loan\r\nApplicants income\r\nYes\r\nYes\r\nOccupiers income\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\nAllowances/ overtime pay e.g. allowances for food, transport, laundry, uniform, shift work, etc.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7836, "end_char_idx": 12441, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d290f07b-8c63-47ad-b746-67e1eb1132ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "d290f07b-8c63-47ad-b746-67e1eb1132ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app1\\data\\eligibility\\ion-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter_income-guidelines.txt", "file_name": "ion-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter_income-guidelines.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16435, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "76456491-ce71-4d02-b3c9-567a3b3eefcb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app1\\data\\eligibility\\ion-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter_income-guidelines.txt", "file_name": "ion-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter_income-guidelines.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16435, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "2e7267a3304be39cc99394b44f7e594cb71a1569d03c8e9038d63bf74f3a9837", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02208034-a45a-4d5e-be0d-039a46ecc870", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app1\\data\\eligibility\\ion-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter_income-guidelines.txt", "file_name": "ion-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter_income-guidelines.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16435, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "684dca44fbd826092986c6ed64298b4e7602338ec4f72c7b4671a98ad8f3778a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Types of income/ allowance considered for assessment of household income and credit assessment:\r\n Types of Income/ Allowance\r\n Considered for\r\nAssessment of household income\r\nCredit assessment for HDB housing loan\r\nApplicants income\r\nYes\r\nYes\r\nOccupiers income\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\nAllowances/ overtime pay e.g. allowances for food, transport, laundry, uniform, shift work, etc.\r\n Yes\r\nClaims / reimbursements\r\nDirectors fee\r\nEmployees benefits e.g. birthday incentives, marriage tokens, etc.\r\nIncentives\r\nOverseas cost of living allowances for working persons\r\nPupillage/ stipends\r\nEmployers CPF contributions\r\n No\r\nBonuses\r\nAnnual Wage Supplement\r\nEmployees share options and other non-monetary remuneration\r\nNational Service allowance\r\nOverseas allowances for applicants on scholarship\r\nPension\r\nNot related to employment and trade, e.g. rental income, alimony/ maintenance fee, and dividend income/ interest from fixed deposit/ savings accounts.\r\nDocuments\r\nWhen you apply for an HFE letter, you will be guided to retrieve your information from Myinfo to minimise form-filling and submission of documents.
