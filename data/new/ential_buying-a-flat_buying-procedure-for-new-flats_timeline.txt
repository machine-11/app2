Milestones
Check eligibility and plan your finances
You must have a valid HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter before you may apply for a flat in our sales launches. The HFE letter will provide you with a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Read our frequently asked questions on the HFE letter.
You may request for an In-Principle Approval from the participating financial institutions when you apply for an HFE letterÂ on theÂ HDB Flat Portal.
Read on how toÂ plan your finances, and work out your budget using our budget calculator.
