 Frequently Asked Questions on Sales Launch 
Frequently Asked Questions on Sales Launch
Read on to find out the answers to some commonly asked questions by flat applicants when they apply for a flat in our public sales exercises.
 Q1: When is the next Build-To-Order (BTO), Sales of Balance Flats (SBF) sales exercise or open booking of flats?
Arrow down icon
In 2024, HDB will conduct 3 BTO exercises and 1 SBF exercise.
With 3 BTO launches, home buyers can look forward to a bigger housing supply and a wider range of flats and locations at each launch. Applicants will thus have a higher chance of success in finding a flat that meets their budget and needs. In addition, a wider gap between sales launches will provide applicants with greater certainty as it reduces the extent of overlaps between flat selection exercises.
The first 2 BTO sales exercises were held in February and June 2024 respectively, with a concurrent SBF exercise in February 2024. The third BTO sales exercise will be held in October 2024.
 You may visit the HDB Flat Portal for information on our upcoming sales launches and subscribe to our HDB eAlert Service to receive notifications about them.
 Q2: What are Standard, Plus, and Prime HDB Flats?
Arrow down icon
From the October 2024 sales launch onwards, new BTO projects will be classified as Standard, Plus, and Prime based on their locational attributes:
Standard flats will come with the standard subsidies and standard restrictions that are applied to all BTO flats. They will continue to form the bulk of the housing supply.
Plus flats, a new category of flats, will be in choicer locations within each region across Singapore (e.g. near MRT station, town centre). For example, Plus flats could be offered in the upcoming housing precinct in Bayshore, which is close to amenities such as MRT stations, a community club and East Coast Park. These flats will come with more subsidies and tighter restrictions, compared to the Standard BTO flats.
Prime flats are in the choicest locations within Singapore, usually closer to the city centre. They will come with the most subsidies across the 3 categories, and will have the tightest conditions. These flats are currently offered under the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model.
Read more on the new BTO classification.
 Q3: Can I apply for a flat in this sales launch?
Arrow down icon
You must have a valid HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letterÂ before you can apply for a flat in our sales launches. The HFE letter will provide you with a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Second-timers will also be informed on the resale levy/ premiumÂ payable for the purchase of another subsidised flat from HDB.
You may read our frequently asked questions on the HFE letter.
 Q4: When must I apply for the HFE letter if I wish to participate in the upcoming sales launch?
Arrow down icon
If you intend to buy a flat, do apply for an HFE letter early.Â  It takes about a month to process your HFE letter application after HDB has received all the required documents. The processing time may be longer before and during the month of the sales launch due to high application volume. An SMS and email notification will be sent once the outcome is available.
 Q5: How do I work out a budget to finance the flat purchase?
Arrow down icon
The budget is based on your available funds to pay for the flat purchase, namely:
Amount of housing loan from HDB or a financial institution;
CPF savings in the Ordinary Account;
CPF housing grants (if eligible); and
Cash savings
 Find out more on how you may budget for a flat purchase and use our financial tools to help you in the planning before you commit to a flat purchase.
 Q6: What are the documents required when I apply for a flat?
Arrow down icon
Other than a valid HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter, you do not need to submit any documents when submitting a flat application.
We will inform you of any documents required, if you are shortlisted in the computer ballot and invited to book a flat.
 Q7: I am interested in more than 1 town or flat type. Can I submit more than 1 application in a sales launch?
Arrow down icon
No. You may only submit 1 application for 1 town and flat type in a sales launch. During a sales launch comprising a BTO exercise and an SBF exercise, you may either apply for the BTO exercise or the SBF exercise, but not both.
 Q8: How do I apply for the Deferred Income Assessment?
Arrow down icon
Those who fulfil the eligibility conditions for the Deferred Income Assessment will qualify. If you are eligible to defer your income assessment, you will be informed during your flat booking appointment. No application is required. Q9: Can I make changes to my flat application?
Arrow down icon
The changes you can make depends on the stage of your flat application:
Changes to
Stage of flat application
During sales launch
After sales launch
Correspondence address, contact details or priority scheme request (if applicable)
You can log in to My Flat Dashboard to make the changes, if applicable.
Town or flat type applied for
You must cancel your existing flat application and re-apply online during the sales launch application period with the payment of an administrative fee of $10 (inclusive of GST).
You cannot change the town/ flat type you applied for.
Household particulars or financial circumstances
All details of the household in the flat application must be the same as the approved HFE letter.
For any changes in household particulars or financial circumstances, such as income, you must cancel both your HFE letter and flat application, and re-start Step 1 of the HFE letter application i.e. the Preliminary HFE check.
As an HFE letter application takes about a month to process after HDB receives all the required documents, you would not be able to apply for a flat in the ongoing sales launch.
Please contact us via MyRequest@HDB. If the changes render you ineligible to continue with the flat purchase, your flat application will be cancelled. The usual financial forfeitures and consequences for the cancellation will apply, depending on the stage of the application at the time of the cancellation.
Cancellation of flat application
Financial forfeitures and consequences for current and future applications apply when you cancel your flat application at various stages of the application.
Please note that once a flat application is cancelled, it cannot be reinstated. Read more on cancellation of flat application.
 Q10: When will I be notified of the ballot results? How will I be notified?
Arrow down icon
You will receive an email notification to log in to the HDB Flat Portal to check the ballot results within 2 months after the application period has closed. The timeline to release the ballot results is dependent on the sales launch and flat supply.
