If the changes render you ineligible to continue with the flat purchase, your flat application will be cancelled. The usual financial forfeitures and consequences for the cancellation will apply, depending on the stage of the application at the time of the cancellation.
 Optional Component Scheme (OCS)
 The OCS is a flexible, opt-in scheme to give you the added convenience of having your home closer to move-in condition when you collect your keys.
Arrow down icon
OCS is offered to buyers of new flats offered in a Build-To-Order exercise for added convenience. You may opt in for OCS items during the flat booking appointment. The cost of the optional components will be added to the flat price.
Do note that if you do not opt for the OCS items during the flat booking appointment, you will not be able to opt for them later. This is because the building contractor of the new project would have already ordered the required quantities and may have even completed the installations in other flats.
For projects built using the Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction method, the flats will come with full floor finishes, internal doors, and sanitary fittings. Hence, the OCS is not applicable to these projects.
Open concept 'White flats' will come with an open living and bedroom space for greater flexibility in configuring homes. Flat buyers of the pilot project at Kallang-Whampoa in the October 2024 sales exercise will be able to opt for the 'White Flat' layout when they are invited to book a flat.
Optional components
You may choose to have the following items installed in your booked flat[1]:
