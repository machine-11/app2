 Fresh Start Housing Scheme 
Fresh Start Housing Scheme
The Fresh Start Housing Scheme (Fresh Start) aims to help second-timer^ families with young children, who are currently living in public rental flats, to own their next homes. By integrating financial assistance for housing with personal responsibility and social support, the scheme lets families purchase a 2-room Flexi or 3-room flat on a shorter lease.
Interested households need to apply for and be placed under the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, before they can apply for a flat.
^ Second-timer refers to households who have previously enjoyed 1 housing subsidy
Key features
Households under the Fresh Start Housing Scheme will be assisted in the following ways:
Types of flats and lease options
You can buy a 2-room Flexi or 3-room flat on a shorter lease in our sales launches, i.e. Build-To-Order (BTO) or Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises, or open booking of flats, which will be more affordable than flats with the usual 99-year lease
The lease options range from 45 years to 65 years, but it must cover all owners and their spouses till they are 95 years old
Minimum Occupation period
The minimum occupation period of the flat is 20 years.
HDB concessionary housing loan
You can take up an HDB concessionary housing loan, subject to credit assessment.
Cap on resale levy
Capped at $30,000
Levy will be reduced based on the length of the lease chosen
Grant amount and disbursement
For applications made from sales launch in May 2022, applicants can receive the Fresh Start Housing Grant of $50,000* comprising:
A $35,000* lump sum disbursed into eligible applicants CPF Ordinary Accounts before key collection
The remaining grant of up to $15,000 will be disbursed into eligible applicants CPF Ordinary Accounts equally over 5 years, after key collection
* For applications made before the May 2022 sales launch, applicants will receive a total grant of $35,000. Please refer to the following table for a summary.

Do not own other properties overseas or locally, and have not disposed of any within the last 30 months
Other things to note
You and your co-applicants must apply for a flat within the 1-year validity period of the LSA. Otherwise, the Fresh Start status and HDB loan application will lapse
You and your co-applicants may apply for a 2-room Flexi or 3-room flat on shorter leases in any estate, except for flats in projects under the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model
To collect the keys to a flat booked under the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, you and your co-applicants must renew the LSA annually and have a valid LSA when the flat is ready. If the LSA is not renewed before its expiry, your flat and HDB loan application will be cancelled, and you forfeit 5% of the flat price
The amount of HDB concessionary loan that Fresh Start families will be eligible for is subject to the prevailing Loan-to-Value Limit of up to 80% of the flat price
At least 10% of the flat price must be paid for using your CPF savings in Ordinary Account (OA) and/ or cash. The remaining can be paid by Fresh Start Grant and/ or CPF savings in OA/cash
Once you buy a flat under the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, you will have enjoyed two housing subsidies and will no longer be eligible to buy another flat from HDB
You must renew the LSA annually for 5 years, from the date after key collection. Each disbursement of the Fresh Start Grant is subject to your successful annual renewal of the LSA with HDB. Your family may need to attend face-to-face interviews with HDB officers for the renewal of the LSA
