Arrow down icon
You can view information such as the Probable Completion Date (PCD) and pictorial updates of the project via My HDBPage.
The PCD is the estimated completion date of your flat. The actual completion date may vary depending on the construction progress.
Individual blocks within the same project are progressively completed to facilitate key collection for all residents. While some blocks may look ready externally, there may still be works in progress, such as installation of doors and sanitary fittings, electrical installations and cleaning works.
We will invite you to collect the keys of your flat as soon as they are available.
 Preparing for your key collection
 Take note of these common scenarios while waiting for key collection.
Arrow down icon
Changes to household particulars or financial circumstances

Existing HDB flat owners
If you own an HDB flat#, you must dispose of it by way of sale or transfer within 6 months of collecting the keys to your other flat. If you need the net proceeds from the sale of your flat to pay for your flat purchase, do plan and time the sale of your flat to ensure you will have sufficient funds by the time of your key collection appointment.

Arrow down icon
HPS is compulsory if you use CPF savings to pay the housing loan instalments.
In the event of death, terminal illness, or total permanent disability before the insured person turns 65, the HPS will settle the outstanding housing loan up to the sum insured, based on the share of cover applied. 
The premium is paid annually using your CPF OA savings or cash. The premium amount depends on factors such as the declared percentage of coverage, loan amount, age, and sex of the insured person.
Visit the CPF Board website for more information on HPS. The CPF Board website also has a Home Protection Scheme Premium Calculator, which you may use to estimate the HPS premium amount.

 What you need to do after key collection.
Arrow down icon
After key collection, you will become the flat owner and are liable for the conditions of ownership and payments, such as the housing loan instalments, monthly service and conservancy charges, or annual property tax.
Refer to our checklist when you are ready to move in to your flat. Learn about rectification works for your flat and the renovation guidelines.
Read the conditions after buying to learn about the conditions that all flat owners and occupiers have to follow after moving into your flat, such as the minimum occupation period. Non-occupation of the flat is an infringement of the Housing & Development Act, for which HDB can compulsorily acquire the flat.
For matters regarding the ownership of your flat, please approach your HDB Branch for more information.
