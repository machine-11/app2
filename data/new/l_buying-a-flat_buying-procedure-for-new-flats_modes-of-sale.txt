Modes of Sale
Our modes of sale are as follows:
Build-To-Order (BTO)
Sale of Balance Flats (SBF)
Open booking of flats
Visit the HDB Flat Portal to find out more about the current and upcoming sales launches. Details such as flat types, classification of the flats on offer and pricing, will be available during the sales exercise. If you wish to be notified of the sales exercises, subscribe to HDB eAlert Service. You may also read our frequently asked questions on sales exercise.
Applicants may be eligible for the various priority schemes to increase their chances of getting a flat. Nevertheless, to discourage non-selection of flats and prioritise applicants who are in urgent need to buy a flat, application restrictions will apply if you choose not to book a BTO or SBF flat when you are invited to do so.
Additionally, BTO/ SBF applicants who have received a queue position that is within the flat supply will not be eligible to apply for a flat in subsequent sales exercises until after their flat booking appointment. This is to give other applicants a chance to secure a flat.
 Build-To-Order (BTO)
 The BTO system offers you flexibility in location and timing of your flat purchase. A BTO sales launch offers a range of flat types across a few towns.
Arrow down icon
How the BTO process works
The flat types offered are typically Community Care Apartments, 2-room Flexi, 3-, 4-, 5-room and 3Gen flats. You may apply for your preferred flat type and town, and balloting will be conducted to determine whether your flat application is successful.
First-timer families enjoy higher priority for BTO flats. In cases where the applicants comprise a first-timer and second-timer, the couple will be treated as a first-timer family, with the same priority benefits and privileges.
Here is an overview of the BTO process:
Distribution of flat supply
More new flats are allocated to first-timer families as they have a more pressing need for a home.
For seniors, at least 40%# of the 2-room Flexi public flat supply across Standard, Plus and Prime projects will be set aside for them. Within this, half in Standard and Plus projects and a quarter in Prime projects will be set aside for eligible seniors under the Senior Priority Scheme (SPS). Those who are unsuccessful under the seniors quota will be included in a second round of ballot with other applicants for the balance flat supply. On the other hand, any unused seniors quota will be distributed among the other households.
# Subject to a minimum of 100 units for each BTO project
For second-timer families, up to 15% of the public flat supply will be set aside for them. If there are more second-timer families than the flat supply set aside for them, not all of them will be successful in their flat application, in keeping them within the flat supply set aside for them.

Note: The table above is an illustration for a typical non-FT(PMC) first-timer family.
[1] The count of unsuccessful BTO attempts will be refreshed with effect from the Oct 2024 sales exercise. Going forward, the count will focus on unsuccessful BTO attempts for Standard projects.
[2] The number of ballot chances will be capped at 5 for FT(PMC)s and 4 for non-FT(PMC) first-timer families.
An application is unsuccessful if you are not invited to book a flat (you did not receive a queue number), or the flats have all been booked before your queue number is due to book a flat.
Additional chances are not given for applications for Plus and Prime BTO flats as the flat supply is limited.
 Sale of Balance Flats (SBF)
 SBF sales exercises give you the opportunity to apply for balance flats from earlier BTO sales exercises, surplus Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) replacement flats, repurchased flats, etc.
Arrow down icon
How the SBF process works
A SBF exercise offers a wide range of flat types, locations, and prices. The flat types offered are typically Community Care Apartments, 2-room Flexi, 3-, 4-, 5-room, Executive flats, and 3Gen flats. The flats are usually already under construction, near completion or completed.
There is often strong interest in SBF flats, and the chances of getting a flat are slim. For a better chance to secure a flat, please apply for a BTO flat in Standard projects.
First-timer families enjoy higher priority for SBF flats. In cases where the applicants comprise a first-timer and second-timer, the couple will be treated as a first-timer family, with the same priority benefits and privileges.
Here is an overview of the SBF process:
Distribution of flat supply
More flats are allocated to first-timer families as they have a more pressing need for a home.
For seniors, at least 40% of the 2-room Flexi public flat supply across Standard, Plus and Prime projects will be set aside for them. Within this, half in Standard and Plus projects and a quarter in Prime projects will be set aside for eligible seniors under the Senior Priority Scheme (SPS). Those who are unsuccessful under the seniors’ quota will be included in a second round of balloting with other applicants for the balance flat supply. Any unused seniors’ quota will be distributed among the other households.
For second-timer families, up to 5% of the public flat supply will be set aside for them. If there are more second-timer families than the flat supply set aside for them, not all of them will be successful in their flat application, in keeping them within the flat supply set aside for them.

For 3-room and bigger flats, if there are fewer than 20 units available for public application, all of the flats will be set aside for first-timer families. Only after all of them have been invited to book a flat and if there are any flats remaining, will second-timer families be invited to book a flat.

Here is an overview of the process:
To allow time for the preparation work, online applications will be suspended prior to each inject of fresh supply of flats or when all the flats are booked. To receive notifications on our upcoming sales exercises, please subscribe to HDB eAlert Service.
