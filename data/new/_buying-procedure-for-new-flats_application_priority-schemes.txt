 Buying a Flat Buying Procedure for New Flats
 Application
 Priority Schemes 
Priority Schemes
Priority schemes enhance your chances in the computer ballot for flats offered in the Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises. You may apply for one of the priority schemes in your flat application, if your household meet the eligibility conditions at the point of your HFE letter application.
If you qualify for the Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS), you may apply for one other priority scheme, such as the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) or Third Child Priority Scheme (TCPS).
From mid-2025, priority will be extended to all parents and their children (married or single) when buying an HDB flat to live with or near each other. More details will be announced soon.
Please note that there is no priority or privilege to secure a small queue number to book a flat.
 Priority for first-timers
 As a first-timer applicant, you will enjoy greater priority and other privileges when you apply for a flat from HDB.
Arrow down icon
Among first-timer families, those with young children and young married couples buying their first home may qualify for priority as First-Timer (Parents & Married Couples), or FT(PMC). Read about the FT(PMC) category below to know more about the eligibility criteria and the additional support provided to help them settle down more quickly.
Couples comprising a first-timer and second-timer applicant are also considered as a first-timer family, and may enjoy the same priority benefits as first-timer families.
Privileges for first-timers
Higher proportion of flat supply
A higher proportion of flat supply will be set aside for first-timer families. More information on the distribution of quotas can be found in modes of sale.
Priority schemes
You may apply for one of the priority schemes to enhance your chances in the ballot, if your household meets the eligibility conditions. Read about the various priority schemes, such as Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS) and Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS), below.
Deferred Income Assessment and Staggered Downpayment Scheme
You may also be eligible for deferred income assessment and Staggered Downpayment Scheme.
Additional ballot chance
You will get 2 ballot chances as compared to second-timer applicants who will get 1 ballot chance. If you qualify for FT(PMC), you will get 3 ballot chances. However, in cases where there is an overwhelming demand for flats from first-timers, not all first-timers will be successful in the ballot.
All first-timers, including FT(PMC)s, will get 1 additional chance for every subsequent unsuccessful BTO application for a Standard flat, after they have been unsuccessful for 2 or more BTO applications (as a first-timer family) for Standard flats.

Note: The table above is an illustration for a typical non-FT(PMC) first-timer family.
[1] The count of unsuccessful BTO attempts will be refreshed with effect from the Oct 2024 sales exercise. Going forward, the count will focus on unsuccessful BTO attempts for Standard projects.
[2] The number of ballot chances will be capped at 5 for FT(PMC)s and 4 for non-FT(PMC) first-timer families.
An application is unsuccessful if you are not invited to book a flat (you did not receive a queue number), or the flats have all been booked before your queue number is due to book a flat.
Additional chances are not given for applications for Plus and Prime BTO flats and SBF exercises as the flat supply is limited.
Application restrictions for rejecting a BTO/ SBF flat
If you had been invited to book a flat, but did not do so even though there were units available, you have rejected a chance to book a flat and incurred a non-selection count.
With 1 non-selection count, you will be deemed a second-timer for a year in the computer ballot and all your other flat applications that have been submitted from the October 2023 sales launch onwards will automatically be cancelled. Any additional ballot chances accumulated from your previous unsuccessful BTO applications for Standard flats will also be set to 0.
As there may be situations when flat applicants are left with very limited choices when they are invited to book a flat, HDB will waive the non-selection count for applicants with 10 or fewer BTO flats to choose from; or 5 or fewer SBF flats to choose from.
We strongly encourage applicants to consider carefully before they apply for a flat, and book a flat when they are invited to do so.
 First-Timer (Parents & Married Couples), or FT(PMC) category
 To help young families settle down more quickly, additional support will be provided for applicants who qualify for the FT(PMC) category. 
Arrow down icon
First-timer families who meet all the following eligibility criteria may qualify for the FT(PMC) category:
Families with at least 1 Singapore Citizen child aged 18 and below, or married couples aged 40 and below. This includes married couples who are expecting and have a doctors certification of the pregnancy
Never owned or sold a residential property before, including an HDB flat
Did not have a chance to book a BTO/ SBF flat in the past 5 years prior to their flat application
You do not need to request for the FT(PMC) category when you apply for a flat in our sales launches. HDB will assess and inform you about your eligibility after you have submitted your flat application.
Additional support for FT(PMC) applicants
Additional ballot chance
You will receive 1 additional ballot chance^ when applying for the BTO/SBF exercises, on top of the 2 ballot chances that you will receive as a First-Timer family. This means that you will receive a total of 3 ballot chances when you apply for any flat type in any estate.
^ Capped at 5 additional ballot chances.
First priority under the Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS)
If you apply for a 4-room or smaller Standard BTO flat, you will be given first priority for the flats set aside under the Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS).
 Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS)
 This scheme helps first-timer married couples with children and young married couples to get their flat more easily.
Arrow down icon
Flat allocation
Up to 40% of the public flat supply for BTO flats and up to 60% of the public flat supply for SBF flats are set aside for the applicants.
Eligibility conditions
You and your spouse must be first-timer buyers
You have a Singapore Citizen child (i.e. natural offspring from a legal marriage or legally adopted) who is aged 18 or below. For adoptive parents, you must have the Adoption Order of your child when you apply for a flat
If you or your spouse is expecting, and have a doctor's certification of the pregnancy, you may also apply for the FPPS
If you qualify for the FT(PMC) category, you will be eligible for the FPPS.
Balloting process if you are eligible for FPPS and also applied for another priority scheme, e.g. TCPS
A computerised ballot is conducted for each priority scheme. For example, for a first-timer family with 3 children and is eligible for both the TCPS and FPPS, their application will first be balloted under the TCPS. If that ballot is unsuccessful, their application is balloted again under the FPPS.
 Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS)
 Parents and their married child (or Fianc‚/Fianc‚e applicants) can make a joint application for 2 flats in a BTO project where 2-room Flexi or 3-room flats are integrated in the flat mix.
Arrow down icon
Flat allocation
For parents: Up to 15% of the 2-room Flexi or 3-room flats (minimum of 20 units)
For married child^: Corresponding number of 2-room Flexi or bigger flats

Eligibility conditions

Parents may only apply for a 2-room Flexi or 3-room flat
The married child^ may apply for a 2-room Flexi or bigger flat
How it works
Successful MGPS flat applications will be issued up to 3 queue positions:
Applicants

If the parents and married child decide not to book their respective flats together under the MGPS, they may proceed with their flat applications independently under the Public Scheme, if they are similarly successful under the Public Scheme. HDB will schedule separate flat booking appointments for them to book a flat under the Public Scheme.
 Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS)
 This scheme helps a married child and the parents to live with or close to each other for mutual care and support, by giving greater assurance when they apply for a flat. Fianc‚/Fianc‚e applicants may also apply for the MCPS.
