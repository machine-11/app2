**Buying Procedure for Resale Flats**

1. **Obtain HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) Letter**: Before you can begin the process of buying a resale flat, you must obtain a valid HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter.

2. **Consider Mode of Financing and Budget**: After obtaining the HFE letter, consider your mode of financing and work out a budget that suits your financial situation.

3. **Find a Suitable Flat**: Begin searching for a resale flat that meets your budget and preferences.

4. **Obtain Option to Purchase (OTP)**: Once you agree on a price with the flat sellers, proceed to obtain an Option to Purchase (OTP). If you intend to get an HDB housing loan, ensure you have a valid HFE letter before the sellers grant you the OTP. If financing through a financial institution, a valid Letter of Offer (LO) is necessary.

5. **Use HDB-Prescribed OTP**: You and the flat sellers must use the HDB-prescribed OTP as it is the only valid agreement under the Housing and Development Act. 

6. **Payment of Fees**: At the time the OTP is granted, you must pay the flat sellers an Option Fee, which can range from $1 to $1,000. When you exercise the OTP, you must pay an Option Exercise Fee, which, when combined with the Option Fee, will not exceed $5,000. Negotiation of these amounts is encouraged, and digital payment modes are recommended for independent proof of payment.

7. **Exercise the OTP**:
   - **Step 1: Negotiate and Agree on Resale Price**: You and the flat sellers must mutually agree on the resale price.
   - **Step 2: Granting of OTP**: The flat sellers formally grant you the OTP, filling in required details such as the option date, flat address, purchase price, and option expiry date (21 calendar days from the granting date).
   - **Step 3: Review Purchase During Option Period**: The OTP is valid for 21 calendar days. Use this period to:
     - Confirm your mode of financing through My Flat Dashboard.
     - Submit a Request for Value for the flat if using CPF savings or a housing loan.
   - **Step 4: Exercise the OTP or Allow to Expire**: You must exercise the OTP within the Option Period. If you do not wish to proceed, let the OTP expire, in which case you will forfeit the Option Fee.

8. **Submitting the Resale Application**: After exercising the OTP:
   - Both you and the sellers must decide when to submit the resale application portions separately.
   - Complete the resale application is contingent upon both parties submitting their applications and required documents within specified timeframes.

9. **Important Note**: The applicant(s) and occupier(s) in the resale application must match those in the HFE letter. If changes are required, follow the necessary steps outlined.
