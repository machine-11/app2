or engage the services of a salesperson for a fee.  \r\n\r\n**Manage the purchase on your own**  \r\nThe following guide will prepare you for the flat purchase.  \r\n\r\n1. **Check your eligibility to buy a resale flat**  \r\n   You must have a valid HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter before you can obtain an Option to Purchase (OTP) from a flat seller.  \r\n   Start your journey by applying for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter via My Flat Dashboard for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. The HFE letter will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Read our frequently asked questions on the HFE letter.  \r\n   If you intend to get a housing loan from a financial institution, you must have a valid Letter of Offer (LO) before you exercise the OTP. You may request for an In-Principle Approval (IPA) from the participating financial institutions when you apply for an HFE letter and request to convert the IPA to LO via My Flat Dashboard.  \r\n\r\n2. **Consider your budget**  \r\n   Plan your finances and work out your budget before you search for a suitable flat.  \r\n   You may use a combination of cash, savings in your CPF Ordinary Account, and a housing loan from HDB or a financial institution (FI) regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to buy a flat.  \r\n   To plan for your flat purchase, you may use the budget calculator to estimate your budget and compare the information on housing loans offered by HDB and our participating FIs. Learn more about the mode of financing for your flat, where we provide a breakdown of the payments required, and the types of housing loans available and financial tools you can use. Make sure you set aside some cash savings for renovation and other necessary expenses to settle into your new home.  \r\n\r\n3. **Search for a flat**  \r\n   Search for a resale flat using HDB\u2019s Resale Flat Listing (RFL) service or through other reputable platforms.  \r\n   After you have obtained an HFE letter (as well as an In-principle Approval letter for a housing loan from the financial institutions, if applicable) and worked out your budget, you may browse resale flat listings on the HDB Flat Portal. Read our guide on finding a flat for more information on the Resale Flat Listing (RFL) service and other resources you can use to help you plan and prepare for your flat purchase.  \r\n   You may also refer to property portals, newspaper advertisements or social media sections in your search for a flat.  \r\n   Consider the following factors:  \r\n   - Your budget  \r\n   - Your housing needs, e.g. to live near parents\u2019 or child\u2019s home, place of work, schools, etc.  \r\n   - Your ethnic group to buy a flat in the block, or your nationality if you are a Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) household. Learn more about the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) and SPR quota  \r\n   - Remaining lease of the flat*  \r\n   You may be approached by salespersons offering to act for you. If you are handling the purchase on your own, please tell them so.  \r\n   *CPF usage and HDB housing loan limits will depend on the extent the remaining lease can cover the youngest buyer to the age of 95. You can check the maximum amount of CPF savings and loan that can be used for housing by using CPF Board's e-service and HDB housing loan using our payment plan calculator.  \r\n\r\n4. **Attend flat viewings**  \r\n   When you attend a flat viewing appointment, these are some considerations to keep in mind.  \r\n   If you have a valid HFE letter, you may arrange flat viewing appointments with flat sellers or their appointed salesperson(s) in the resale flat listings on the HDB Flat Portal. Refer to our user guide and instructional video for more details on how to do so.  \r\n   You may arrange for viewings at different times of the day and week to better gauge if a flat is suitable for you. During a viewing, do consider the following:  \r\n   - Condition of the flat, e.g. renovation and upkeep  \r\n   - Spalling concrete, cracks, or leakages on ceiling or wall  \r\n   - Flat orientation, e.g. north, south, east, or west  \r\n   - Any tenants in the flat and whether they can move out by the resale completion date  \r\n   - Signs of moneylending activities from, e.g.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4442, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93d67644-d212-4b91-bf61-7d59c0622ef0": {"__data__": {"id_": "93d67644-d212-4b91-bf61-7d59c0622ef0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_name": "-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10832, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "98367aa2-e7ac-45e7-bcc9-05b4726a1579", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_name": "-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10832, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "7711f92d1acde063863ea696c6c0575b6b6b73dcaeb4eb3fa85ea1e0792e3fd1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8af8c80e-4c8b-495c-9869-8d4377bc6dcf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_name": "-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10832, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "75959a44f897f4a803b71118204a2d5817f845abd2f7deba2b125131b7671f0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e963ea25-27a2-4036-8443-e450c27b3cb6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d813ee30181b88992dcd9d9e3f37942af5ee25495e71c26f2e13f7a6606e8f08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If you have a valid HFE letter, you may arrange flat viewing appointments with flat sellers or their appointed salesperson(s) in the resale flat listings on the HDB Flat Portal.

Take note of the answers and observe their reactions.  \r\n\r\n5. **Proof of flat ownership**  \r\n   Request the flat sellers to show proof that they own the flat and are eligible to sell it. Documents such as a printout from the flat sellers\u2019 My HDBPage at HDB InfoWEB, property tax statement, town council statement, or title deed are examples of documents that can confirm the owners of a flat.  \r\n\r\n6. **Negotiate the price**  \r\n   Price negotiation is not simply about offering the lowest price and haggling with flat sellers. Here are some useful tips.  \r\n   - **Prepare yourself:** Be mindful of your budget, which you must consider before starting your search for a flat. Make a reasonable offer, based on your budget and your perceived value of the flat.  \r\n   - **Arm yourself with information and alternatives:** You are in a better position to negotiate when you have:  \r\n     - More information about the flat, such as the flat type, remaining lease, and recent transacted prices of similar flats nearby  \r\n     - Found other flats which you are open to consider buying  \r\n   - **Time and timing:** Do not rush into your flat purchase. Give yourself time to look around and assess your choices. When you see a flat that suits your budget and needs, take your time to inspect the flat and its condition before deciding on the purchase.  \r\n\r\n7. **Other matters**  \r\n   Other than the flat price, there are other matters you must consider when you negotiate with the flat sellers:  \r\n   - **Deposit:** comprising Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee  \r\n   You must pay flat sellers an Option Fee when they grant you an Option to Purchase (OTP), and an Option Exercise Fee when you exercise the OTP.  \r\n   You may negotiate the amounts of Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee with the flat sellers, which will form part of the resale price.  \r\n   - **Payment by flat buyers to sellers:**  \r\n     - Stage of OTP  \r\n     - Amount to pay  \r\n     - Option Fee - Granting of OTP - Between $1 and $1,000  \r\n     - Option Exercise Fee - Exercising of OTP - An amount, which when including the Option Fee, will not exceed $5,000  \r\n   You are encouraged to make payment using digital payment modes to secure independent proof of payment.  \r\n\r\n   - **Submission of resale application:** Under Clause 12 of the OTP, you and the sellers must agree on the timeframe to submit the resale application to HDB. This is a contractual term between you and the sellers. Once it is agreed upon, it may be varied only with mutual consent. Please submit the resale application as soon as possible to minimise unforeseeable changes, e.g. EIP and SPR quotas, untoward events, etc.  \r\n\r\n   - **Extension of stay:** To ease sellers\u2019 transition to their next home, sellers may arrange with you to extend their stay temporarily in the flat, for up to 3 months after the resale completion. The temporary extension of stay is subject to your agreement. If you agree, the minimum occupation period that you have to fulfil after the flat purchase will start only when the sellers have moved out of your flat.  \r\n\r\n   - **Enhanced Contra Facility:** If you are planning to sell your existing HDB flat and buy another resale HDB flat, you may consider applying for the Enhanced Contra Facility (ECF).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3690, "end_char_idx": 8082, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e963ea25-27a2-4036-8443-e450c27b3cb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e963ea25-27a2-4036-8443-e450c27b3cb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_name": "-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10832, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "98367aa2-e7ac-45e7-bcc9-05b4726a1579", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_name": "-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10832, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "7711f92d1acde063863ea696c6c0575b6b6b73dcaeb4eb3fa85ea1e0792e3fd1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "93d67644-d212-4b91-bf61-7d59c0622ef0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_name": "-contract_planning-considerations_managing-the-flat-purchase.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10832, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "9334bc881be07f4617fe39da77ab0e242a1067c23219d7fded601626fe9eaf09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This is a contractual term between you and the sellers.

Do ensure that you have sufficient funds for all the payments.  \r\n\r\n- **Cash**  \r\nYou must use cash at the following stages:  \r\n  1. Option to Purchase  \r\n  2. Deposit to seller for Option to Purchase (OTP)  \r\n     You must pay the sellers a deposit ($2 to $5,000), which consists of the Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee, during the granting and exercising of the Option to Purchase respectively.  \r\n  3. Processing fee for Request for Value  \r\n     If you intend to buy a resale flat using your CPF savings and/or a housing loan, make a Request for Value to HDB to determine the flat\u2019s value.

When the allowed CPF amount is used up, buyers have to pay the balance flat purchase price and/or monthly mortgage instalments in cash. This will help buyers to set aside CPF savings for their housing needs during retirement (e.g. buying a replacement property).  \r\n\r\nFor information on the use of CPF savings, you may use the CPF Board's online calculator. For further enquiries on the use of CPF savings, please visit CPF Board\u2019s website.  \r\n\r\n**Housing loan**  \r\nTo finance your flat purchase, you may choose to take a housing loan from HDB or a financial institution (FI) regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  \r\nBuying a flat is a long-term commitment, and mortgage payments can stretch up to 25 years or more. Hence, it is important to exercise financial prudence so that you can sustain the monthly payments.  \r\n\r\n**Housing loan from HDB**  \r\nBefore buying a flat and taking a housing loan from HDB, you need to first obtain an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter. The HFE letter will provide you with a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amount of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for.  \r\n\r\nDo take note of the following:  \r\n- **Valid HFE letter**  \r\n  You will need a valid HFE letter at all of the following stages:  \r\n  - Before obtaining an Option to Purchase (OTP) from a flat seller  \r\n  - When you exercise the OTP  \r\n  - When you submit the resale application  \r\n\r\n- **Household status**  \r\n  Your household\u2019s eligibility for housing subsidies and HDB housing loan is assessed based on the core family nucleus in your HFE letter application, which is formed by the core member(s). Core members refer to the applicant(s) and occupier(s) in an HFE letter application who enable the applicant(s) to qualify for a flat purchase under an eligibility scheme. All core members must remain in the flat application, and physically occupy the flat during the minimum occupation period (MOP) after the flat purchase. Their names cannot be removed.  \r\n  You and all core members must not have taken 2 or more housing loans from HDB.  \r\n\r\n- **Second HDB housing loan**  \r\n  The eligible loan amount will be granted only if you have paid for the flat purchase with the CPF refund and up to 50% of the cash proceeds from the disposal of your current or last owned flat/property.  \r\n\r\n- **Retaining up to $20,000 CPF savings in the Ordinary Account (OA)**  \r\n  You and your co-applicant(s) may each retain up to $20,000 CPF savings in the Ordinary Account (OA). The rest of the available CPF OA balances must be used to pay for the flat purchase.  \r\n\r\n- **Remaining lease of flat**  \r\n  If the lease can cover the youngest core member up to the age of 95 and above, the Loan-to-Value (LTV) limit will be 75% of the lower of the resale price and value.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3579, "end_char_idx": 8030, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f8ad9d9-1020-474f-aaa7-3a964d937deb": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f8ad9d9-1020-474f-aaa7-3a964d937deb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\-for-resale-flats_plan-source-and-contract_mode-of-financing.txt", "file_name": "-for-resale-flats_plan-source-and-contract_mode-of-financing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10769, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b1caf785-b08d-4166-8050-ba3b6b760b60", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\-for-resale-flats_plan-source-and-contract_mode-of-financing.txt", "file_name": "-for-resale-flats_plan-source-and-contract_mode-of-financing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10769, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "969bb029934c22cf25b17b955a0aceb2a5ae4aea6fa3946057d1826d4197e498", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f195d6f1-3bf0-44ca-b98d-a44349bca1f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\-for-resale-flats_plan-source-and-contract_mode-of-financing.txt", "file_name": "-for-resale-flats_plan-source-and-contract_mode-of-financing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10769, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "a01a42d06dfbb52dc976393e0c68f9f5ff9fd7867ecd0b68c277ec9cbe5de777", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "You and all core members must not have taken 2 or more housing loans from HDB.  \r\n\r\n- **Second HDB housing loan**  \r\n  The eligible loan amount will be granted only if you have paid for the flat purchase with the CPF refund and up to 50% of the cash proceeds from the disposal of your current or last owned flat/property.  \r\n\r\n- **Retaining up to $20,000 CPF savings in the Ordinary Account (OA)**  \r\n  You and your co-applicant(s) may each retain up to $20,000 CPF savings in the Ordinary Account (OA).

Integration Policy (EIP) quota for the block and neighbourhood, and if applicable, the Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) quota as well.\r\n\r\nHow the EIP and SPR quota work\r\nThe EIP quota applies for the purchase of an HDB flat. In addition, non-Malaysian SPR households must meet the SPR quota.\r\n\r\nYou may be eligible to buy a flat if:\r\n- You and the flat seller are of the same ethnic group and household citizenship; or\r\n- After your flat purchase, the number of households of your ethnic group remains within the block and neighbourhood limits. In addition, for non-Malaysian SPR households, the number of SPR households remains within the SPR quota.\r\n\r\nCheck your eligibility\r\nYou may use our e-Service to check if you are eligible to buy an HDB resale flat in a particular block or neighbourhood under the EIP/ SPR quota. The prevailing EIP and SPR quotas for the month are also displayed on the resale flat listings on the HDB Flat Portal. The quotas are updated on the 1st of each month.\r\n\r\nPlease check to ensure compliance with the EIP/ SPR quota at each of the following milestones:\r\n- Flat sellers grant the Option to Purchase (OTP);\r\n- You exercise the OTP; and\r\n- You and the flat sellers submit the respective portion of the resale application.\r\n\r\n* A resale application is completed only when HDB receives both the buyers\u2019 and sellers\u2019 portions of the resale application and the necessary supporting documents.\r\n\r\nAbout the EIP\r\nThe EIP is put in place to preserve Singapore\u2019s multi-cultural identity and promote racial integration and harmony. It ensures that there is a balanced mix of the various ethnic communities in HDB towns. The EIP limits are set at block and neighbourhood levels based on the ethnic make-up of Singapore. \r\n\r\nFor the purchase of an HDB flat, a household with members of different ethnic groups may choose to classify their household ethnicity under the ethnicity of any buyer(s) or spouse according to the race shown on their NRIC. Once an ethnicity is chosen for the household, it will remain the same when the flat owners subsequently sell their flat on the open market.\r\n\r\nAbout the SPR quota\r\nThe SPR quota ensures that SPR families can better integrate into the local community. Malaysians are excluded from this quota because of their close cultural and historical similarities with Singaporeans. Non-Malaysian SPR households applying to buy an HDB resale flat need to be within the SPR quota for the block (8%) and neighbourhood (5%).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2566, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d4b84ae-b27e-4426-a596-0e3e0c0b7034": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d4b84ae-b27e-4426-a596-0e3e0c0b7034", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\esale-flats_plan-source-and-contract_planning-considerations.txt", "file_name": "esale-flats_plan-source-and-contract_planning-considerations.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3690, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fec22b7e-6343-4b05-a1c1-9a3ae0c67016", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\super\\Documents\\abc\\app2\\data\\resale\\esale-flats_plan-source-and-contract_planning-considerations.txt", "file_name": "esale-flats_plan-source-and-contract_planning-considerations.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3690, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "be4f2c6f34923a26f492f55f9045c9657994d312ba3c3ee52eac9ac7f1e14df7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Start your journey by applying for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter via My Flat Dashboard for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey.

If financing through a financial institution, a valid Letter of Offer (LO) is necessary.\r\n\r\n5. **Use HDB-Prescribed OTP**: You and the flat sellers must use the HDB-prescribed OTP as it is the only valid agreement under the Housing and Development Act. \r\n\r\n6. **Payment of Fees**: At the time the OTP is granted, you must pay the flat sellers an Option Fee, which can range from $1 to $1,000. When you exercise the OTP, you must pay an Option Exercise Fee, which, when combined with the Option Fee, will not exceed $5,000. Negotiation of these amounts is encouraged, and digital payment modes are recommended for independent proof of payment.\r\n\r\n7. **Exercise the OTP**:\r\n   - **Step 1: Negotiate and Agree on Resale Price**: You and the flat sellers must mutually agree on the resale price.\r\n   - **Step 2: Granting of OTP**: The flat sellers formally grant you the OTP, filling in required details such as the option date, flat address, purchase price, and option expiry date (21 calendar days from the granting date).\r\n   - **Step 3: Review Purchase During Option Period**: The OTP is valid for 21 calendar days. Use this period to:\r\n     - Confirm your mode of financing through My Flat Dashboard.\r\n     - Submit a Request for Value for the flat if using CPF savings or a housing loan.\r\n   - **Step 4: Exercise the OTP or Allow to Expire**: You must exercise the OTP within the Option Period. If you do not wish to proceed, let the OTP expire, in which case you will forfeit the Option Fee.\r\n\r\n8. **Submitting the Resale Application**: After exercising the OTP:\r\n   - Both you and the sellers must decide when to submit the resale application portions separately.\r\n   - Complete the resale application is contingent upon both parties submitting their applications and required documents within specified timeframes.\r\n\r\n9. **Important Note**: The applicant(s) and occupier(s) in the resale application must match those in the HFE letter.

The HFE letter will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Read our frequently asked questions on the HFE letter.  \r\nYou may request for an In-Principle Approval from the participating financial institutions when you apply for an HFE letter.  \r\n\r\nStep 3: Search for a suitable flat and obtain an Option to Purchase (OTP) from flat seller  \r\nAfter obtaining an HFE letter, you may look for a suitable flat that meets your budget and household needs.  \r\nBrowse resale flat listings on the HDB Flat Portal. Read our guide on finding a flat for more information on the Resale Flat Listing (RFL) service and other resources you can use to help plan and prepare for your flat purchase.  \r\nYou can either manage the purchase on your own or engage the service of a salesperson for a fee.

The right of survivorship applies. This means that should any co-owner passes away, his/her interest in the flat will be automatically passed on to the remaining co-owner(s). This is regardless of whether a will has been made by the deceased co-owner.  \r\n**Tenancy-in-common**  \r\nEach co-owner holds a separate and definite share in the flat.
