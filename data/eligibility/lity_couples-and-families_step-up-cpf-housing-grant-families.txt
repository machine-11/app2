Private residential property
Non-residential property

[2] E.g. residential with commercial at 1st storey or commercial and residential zoning.
 [3] E.g. properties with a residential component, such as HDB shop with living quarters or shophouse.
A property under a non-residential land zoning and/ or the permitted use does not include housing.
This may include commercial properties (e.g. shops or offices), industrial properties, market/ hawker stalls, or vacant/ plantation/ agricultural land.
Private residential property
All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application:

[5] This is regardless of the share of ownership in the non-residential property. If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.
 [6] Prime flats include Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) flats sold before October 2024 sales exercise. The eligibility criteria for resale Prime flats follow the prevailing BTO eligibility criteria.
