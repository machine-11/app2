Private residential property
Non-residential property
A house, building, land that is under a residential land zoning (including land with multiple land zoning[1]), Executive Condominium (EC) unit, privatised HUDC flat and mixed use development[2].
[1] E.g. residential with commercial at 1st storey or commercial and residential zoning.
 [2] E.g. properties with a residential component, such as HDB shop with living quarters or shophouse.
A property under a non-residential land zoning and/ or the permitted use does not include housing.
This may include commercial properties (e.g. shops or offices), industrial properties, market/ hawker stalls, or vacant/ plantation/ agricultural land.

[4] This is regardless of the share of ownership in the non-residential property. If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.
