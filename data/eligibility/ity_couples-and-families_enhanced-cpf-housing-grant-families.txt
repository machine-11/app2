If you are buying a resale flat, you must first qualify for the CPF Housing Grants for resale flats (Families) before applying for the EHG. You may also apply for the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) (Families) if you meet the eligibility conditions.
Apply for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter via the HDB Flat Portal for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to buy a new or resale flat, as well as the amount of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for.
Core family nucleus
A households eligibility for housing subsidies and HDB housing loan is assessed based on the core family nucleus, which is formed by the core member(s). Core members refer to the applicant(s) and occupier(s) in an HFE letter application who enable the household to qualify for a flat purchase under an eligibility scheme. All core members must remain in the flat application, and physically occupy the flat during the minimum occupation period (MOP) after the flat purchase. Their names cannot be removed.

Ownership/ interest in property in Singapore or overseas other than HDB flat
Interest or ownership in a property
You are considered to own or have an interest in a property if you have acquired a property through purchase or when it is:
Acquired by gift;
Inherited as a beneficiary under a will or from the Intestate Succession Act;
Owned, acquired, or disposed of through nominees; or
Acquired by holding on trust for another person/ entity.
The conditions on ownership/ interest in private residential and non-residential property apply to all local and overseas properties that are completed or uncompleted, and include but are not limited to the following:
Private residential property
Non-residential property
A house, building, land that is under a residential land zoning (including land with multiple land zoning[2]), Executive Condominium (EC) unit, privatised HUDC flat and mixed use development[3].
[2] E.g. residential with commercial at 1st storey or commercial and residential zoning.
 [3] E.g. properties with a residential component, such as HDB shop with living quarters or shophouse.
A property under a non-residential land zoning and/ or the permitted use does not include housing.
This may include commercial properties (e.g. shops or offices), industrial properties, market/ hawker stalls, or vacant/ plantation/ agricultural land.
Private residential property
All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application:
Must not own or have an interest in any local or overseas private residential property; and
Must not have disposed of any private residential property in the last 30 months, from the legal completion date[4], before the HFE letter application.
[4] For example, if the private residential property was disposed of on 1 January 2024, based on the legal completion date of disposal, you may apply for an HFE letter to buy a flat from HDB, resale Plus or Prime flat, or resale flat with CPF housing grant(s), or take an HDB housing loan on or after 1 July 2026.
Non-residential property
All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application can, as a household, own or have an interest in up to 1 non-residential property[5] at HFE letter application, if they wish to buy a flat from HDB, a resale Plus/ Prime[6] flat, or a resale Standard/ non-SPP[7] flat with CPF housing grant(s).
If applicants and occupiers own or have an interest in more than 1 non-residential property, they must have disposed of the other non-residential properties at least 30 months (counted from the legal completion date of the disposal of the interest)ÿapplying for an HFE letter.
[5] This is regardless of the share of ownership in the non-residential property. If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.
 [6] Prime flats include Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) flats sold before October 2024 sales exercise. The eligibility criteria for resale Prime flats follow the prevailing BTO eligibility criteria.
 [7] Non-SPP flats refer to all resale flats that were not sold under the new flat classification, i.e., not classified as Standard, Plus and Prime flats.
Amount
The amount is based on the average gross monthly household income assessed over the months worked during the 12-month period, which ends 2 months preceding the month of the HFE letter application. The incomes of all working persons in the household (all applicants and occupiers) are included in the assessment. Households with lower household incomes will receive a bigger grant amount.
Please refer to theÿaverage monthly household income and corresponding EHG amount (PDF, 46KB).
Distribution and usage of EHG
If your household is eligible for the EHG, first-timer SC members of the core family nucleus will receive the grant based on their eligible share. It will be credited into their CPF Ordinary Accounts.
The EHG received by core applicants can be used to:
Offset the purchase price of the flat
Reduce the housing loan required for the flat purchase
