Read our frequently asked questions on the HFE letter and how to apply for one.
Integrated loan application service
You may request an In-Principle Approval (IPA) from the participating financial institutions (FIs) when you apply for an HFE letter. The IPA will provide you with the FIs indicative loan amount. Your chosen FI(s) will reach out to you directly on the outcome(s) of your IPA application(s) and you will be able to confirm their loan offer(s) through the HDB Flat Portal after you have secured a flat purchase.

 Validity and possible review of HFE letter
 Understand when and why your HFE letter may be reviewed.
Arrow down icon
Validity of HFE letter
The HFE letter is valid for 9 months from the date of issue.
If you have already submitted a flat application with your HFE letter, you may proceed with the flat purchase even if the HFE letter has since expired.ÿÿ
Possible review of HFE letter
The outcome of your HFE letter will be reviewed if:
Any given information is untrue or incorrect
You and any persons listed in the application do not comply with any terms and conditions to buy an HDB flat, apply for CPF housing grants and/ or take up an HDB housing loan
There are any changes in your family members, or other circumstances such as changes in HDBs policies and/ or processes which may affect your eligibility to buy an HDB flat, apply for CPF housing grants and/ or take up an HDB housing loan
If you book an uncompleted flat with HDB, we will review your financial position nearer the completion of the flat, to confirm that there are no adverse changes in your ability to service the HDB housing loan. Otherwise, the loan amount may be reduced.
Use of HFE letter and changes in household details
The applicant(s) and occupier(s) listed in your new or resale flat application must remain the same as those in your HFE letter application.ÿ
If there are changes to your household details, this may affect your eligibility to buy an HDB flat, obtain CPF housing grants and/ or take up an HDB housing loan and hence, invalidate your HFE letter. Accordingly, HDB reserves the right to cancel your new or resale flat application(s).ÿ
For new flat application, the usual financial forfeitures and consequences for the cancellation will apply, depending on the stage of the application at the time of the cancellation.
For resale flat application, you will remain liable to the flat seller under the Option to Purchase which you have exercised.
If you need to make changes, please follow the steps below, depending on the stage of your HFE letter application:
Stage of HFE Letter Application
Procedure
Pending approval
Cancel your HFE letter. After cancellation, apply for a fresh HFE letter (i.e. complete Step 1 and Step 2 of the buying process again) by logging in to the HDB Flat Portal.
Approved
There is no action required if there is a change in your household income.
 If you need to make the following changes:
Addition/ removal of household member(s)
Change in status from an applicant to an occupier or vice versa
Marital status
Citizenship
Ownership of private properties
Before submission of new or resale flat application
Cancel and apply for a fresh HFE letter (i.e. complete Step 1 and Step 2 of the buying process again) by logging in to the HDB Flat Portal.ÿ
After submission of new or resale flat application
Please write to us via MyRequest@HDB with your HFE reference number and sales registration number (for new flat) or resale case number (for resale flat).
Re-application of HFE letter
If you have already submitted a flat application with your HFE letter, you do not need a fresh HFE letter to continue with the flat application.
If your HFE letter is expiring in the next 30 days and you need more time to submit a new or resale flat application, please apply for a fresh HFE letter.
If there are no changes in the applicant(s) and occupier(s) listed other than their employment or income, please log in to the HDB Flat Portal, select My Flat Dashboard > I am a new/resale flat buyer > View Letter/ Re-apply HFE (Step 2 of Buying Process).
If you need to make other changes, you may refer to theÿchanges in household details for more information.
