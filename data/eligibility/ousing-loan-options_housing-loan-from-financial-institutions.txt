You can apply for an In-Principle Approval (IPA) from the participating FIs through the integrated loan application service on the HDB Flat Portal. After you have confirmed the flat to purchase, you can request your preferred FI to convert the IPA into a Letter of Offer (LO) on the HDB Flat Portal.ÿ
Find out the key considerations and important information below when taking a housing loan from an FI. You may also read our frequently asked questions on applying for a housing loan from FIs through our integrated loan application service.

CPF utilisation
You may use any amount in your CPF OA for flat purchase, up to the applicable limits as follows:
