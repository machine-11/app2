Inherited as a beneficiary under a will or from the Intestate Succession Act;
Owned, acquired, or disposed of through nominees; or
Acquired by holding on trust for another person/ entity.
The conditions on ownership/ interest in private residential and non-residential property apply to all local and overseas properties that are completed or uncompleted, and include but are not limited to the following:
Private residential property
Non-residential property
A house, building, land that is under a residential land zoning (including land with multiple land zoning[2]), Executive Condominium (EC) unit, privatised HUDC flat and mixed use development[3].
[2] E.g. residential with commercial at 1st storey or commercial and residential zoning.
 [3] E.g. properties with a residential component, such as HDB shop with living quarters or shophouse.
A property under a non-residential land zoning and/ or the permitted use does not include housing.
This may include commercial properties (e.g. shops or offices), industrial properties, market/ hawker stalls, or vacant/ plantation/ agricultural land.
Private residential property
All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application:
Must not own or have an interest in any local or overseas private residential property; and
Must not have disposed of any private residential property in the last 30 months, from the legal completion date[4], before the HFE letter application.
[4] For example, if the private residential property was disposed of on 1 January 2024, based on the legal completion date of disposal, you may apply for an HFE letter to buy a flat from HDB, resale Plus or Prime flat, or resale flat with CPF housing grant(s), or take an HDB housing loan on or after 1 July 2026.
Non-residential property
All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application can, as a household, own or have an interest in up to 1 non-residential property[5] at HFE letter application, if they wish to buy a flat from HDB, a resale Plus/ Prime[6] flat, or a resale Standard/ non-SPP[7] flat with CPF housing grant(s).

[5] This is regardless of the share of ownership in the non-residential property. If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.
 [6] Prime flats include Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) flats sold before October 2024 sales exercise. The eligibility criteria for resale Prime flats follow the prevailing BTO eligibility criteria.
